## Goals

Create a better workflow and organizational system for data analysis in R. This includes: 

(a) organizing existing R scripts containing helpful bits of code into one place

(b) getting oriented with and then regularly using GitHub for version control

(c) creating Rmarkdown documents that I can share with colleagues, students,  and generally to keep myself organized

Endgame: Improve my R skills and learn new data analysis methods. Make a series of Rmarkdown documents instead of scripts that are 75% comments. End up with a collection of nice-looking and easily share-able documents that I can give to people who ask nicely.


## How will I tame the chaos?

I have created a new folder to park things like this guide, useful little bits of code and scripts that are not associated with a particular project, books about working in R, and most importantly, folders containing new R projects. Location and contents of that folder:

```{r}
dir("/Users/fastloris/R_general")
```


## GitHub

I will follow the guide [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) to get started with using GitHub.

I can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/i-mansour). My username is 'i-mansour'.


## R Markdown

This document is my first Rmarkdown document. I am learning what to do by checking out the Getting Started section on the  [Rmarkdown website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and the [R markdown chapter in 'R for Data Science'](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html).


## A collection of digital resources:

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is based on packages in the 'tidyverse' universe. There is information about data visualization and exploration, data wrangling and modeling. It also includes a chapter about Rmarkdown.

[R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) discusses the history of R and then goes into some important basics, including installation, R objects, reading and writing data, tidying data (using both base R and later dplyr), loops, functions and regular expressions.

[STAT545](https://stat545.com/) is a data science course developed by Jenny Bryan, a tidyverse developer and author of Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. Data wrangling and visualization, writing functions and creating packages.

[Efficient R programming](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/)

[NEON data](https://www.neonscience.org/data) is a large ecological dataset that could be good for learning new statistical analysis methods. From their website: "NEON collects environmental data and archival samples that characterize plant, animals, soil, nutrients, freshwater and atmosphere from 81 field sites strategically located in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems across the U.S."
